    <h1>About my site</h1>

    <p style="line-height: 20px;">While I was a little bit familiar with web design before this task, I had never completed a fully fledged website before. This task forced me to actually follow through, from start to finish. Because of this, I was forced to re-consider my previous understanding of web-construction and design. This has helped me to become more considerate of the time and effort it actually takes to produce a functional website.</p>

    <h3 style="line-height: 25px;">I came into this task thinking it would be a walk in the park "I already know some HTML, CSS, and JS, this will be easy" - famous last words. I should clarify that I am happy with the final result, but there are several things I would have liked to have added, but I was unable to, simply by virtue of me leaving things to the last minute and not accounting for how long it would realistically take for me to complete tasks.</h3>

    <h2>Things I will do differently next time:</h2>
    <ul style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px;">
        <li><b style="line-height: 20px;">Account for tasks to take 5 times as long as I initially predicted.</b></li>

        <li style="line-height: 20px;">Complete are more substantial wire frame mock-up</li>
        <li style="line-height: 20px;">Spend considerably more time structuring the cascading nature of my CSS. i.e. use my wire frame mock-up to decide what general CSS classes I am going to need so I don't need to constantly re-structure my CSS to eliminate redundancy in the code. This would also allow me to take a component-based approach in building new pages, this would reduce the time taken to fully implement a new page.</li>
        <li style="line-height: 20px;">Spend more time organising files</li>
        <li style="line-height: 20px;">Use Figma or other mock-up software to create a theme and general aesthetic from early on. I wrote my HTML before having any solid idea of how I wanted to style it. This led to me having to constantly refactor my HTML on account of my new CSS.</li>
        <li style="line-height: 20px;">Use CSS variables from the start. I only started using CSS variables from about half way through building the site, which led to me having to refactor everything, but after implementing variables, it took much less time to make stylistic changes and implement themes.</li>
        <li style="line-height: 20px;"></li>
    </ul>
