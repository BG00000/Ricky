      <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items for your Website Assesment</b></h1>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements.  Do not name this page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Please, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
         <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
         <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
            delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
            mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
            differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
            better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
            look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
            might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
            it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
            it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
            style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
            assignment tasks.
         </li>
         <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
         <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br></p>

      <h1><b>Website Release 2.0</b></h1>
      <h2><b>2.1 Call to Actions</b></h2>
      <p>Both my primary and secondary call-to-actions can be viewed on my landing page (index.html)</p>

      <h2><b>3.1 Reflections</b></h2>
      <p><a href="aboutMySite.html">aboutMySite.html</a></p>
      <h2><b>3.2 Alternative CSS</b></h2>
      <p><a href="styleAlt.css">styleAlt.css</a></p>
      <p>It's really just a de-bordered conglomeration of all my file-specific CSS. I didn't have time to do this well. I use script tags at the bottom of the pages with a magic icon in the top left to handle the CSS file switch-over.</p>
      <h2><b>3.3 Social Networking Button(s) or Feed(s)</b></h2>
      <p><a href="about.html">about.html</a></p>
      <p>I used JS to construct share-links (<a href="share.js">share.js</a>) in my footer area at the bottom of every page, but I was told I had to implement the APIs too, so I did that just below my "About Ricky" section.</p>
      <h2><b>3.4 Website Accesibility</b></h2>
      <p>I tried to implement as many accesibility features over the entire site in the stupidly small amount of time I left myself to do this.</p>
      <h2><b>3.5 Website Validation</b></h2>
      <p>I validated many of my files, and fixed multiple errors, but I was unable to make everything perfect, because, again, time.</p>
      <h2><b>3.6 Something Original</b></h2>
      <p>My theme toggler: <a href="scriptMain.js">scriptMain.js</a> line 41 start.</p>
